Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Supporting $tempenver in template implementation:
   This is a crucial addition in support of programming in ATS that
   may potentially be (very) deeply template-based!!!
(*
2: Re-arranging (and duplicating) files containing code of template
   implementation may cause the need for $tempenver to change. It is
   not yet understood what the reason is behind all of this behavior.
*)
3. Fixing a glitch involving tail-call optimization; please see the
   function hidexp_seq_simplify for details.
4. Supporting [reassume]: An assumed abstract type can be reassumed
   so as to make its (original) implementation available in the scope
   of the reassume-declaration.

This is the second release of ATS2, the successor of the ATS
programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given the name
ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

http://www.ats-lang.org

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

Major releases of external packages for ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang-contrib/

Here is a list of major additions and changes since the last release:

1. Support for classdec.
   This feature is primarily for building APIs in ATS for external
   packages written in the OOP-style.

2. Support for ATS-package relocation.
   This feature is primarily for renaming and relocating external ATS
   packages (mostly library APIs). It is supposed to work together with
   atspkgreloc, a tool that does the actual package relocation. The tool
   is yet to be implemented.

3. Support for dot-notation overloading:
//
   symintr .x .y
   extern fun point_get_x (p: point): int
   extern fun point_get_y (p: point): int
   overload .x with point_get_x
   overload .y with point_get_y
//
   These declarations enable the following:
   [p.x] translates into [point_get_x(p)]
   [p.y] translates into [point_get_y(p)]

4. Fixing a very serious bug in pattern-matching compilation

5. Relocating contributed packages from ats2-lang to ats2-lang-contrib

6. Improving atslib: adding code, fixing bugs, improving documentation, etc.

0.0.1

September 2, 2013

This is the first release of ATS2, the successor of the ATS
programming language. The compiler for ATS2 is given the name
ATS/Positats, ATS2/Postiats or simply Postiats.

The official website for ATS is:

http://www.ats-lang.org

ATS-Postiats is hosted at github:

https://github.com/githwxi/ATS-Postiats

Major releases of ATS2 are available at:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/

The actual implementation of ATS2 started in the March of 2011, and
it took about two and one-half years to reach this stage. As of now,
the code base for the compiler of ATS2 consists of 140,000+ lines of
code (LOC), which are nearly all written in ATS.

When compared to ATS1, the single most important new feature is the
template system of ATS2. This is a feature that could potentially change
the way a programmer writes his or her code. One can certainly feel that
this is a very powerful feature (a bit like feeling that OOP is a very
powerful feature). However, how this feature should be properly and
effectively used in practice needs a lot more investigation.

Another thing about ATS2 is that it is a lot leaner than ATS. One can make
good use of ATS2 without any need for compiled library (libatslib.a). Also,
GC support in ATS1 is now removed; if needed, third-party GC (e.g.,
Bohem-GC) can be readily employed.

I will gradually list differences between ATS and ATS2, helping people
make the transition from ATS1 to ATS2.
