ATS Trilogy

Part 1. Dependent Types
Part 2. Linear Types
Part 3. Function Templates

(* ****** ****** *)

Compared to other programming languages, the type system of ATS clearly
stands out in terms of its flexibility and expressiveness. However, if
types are ignored, then programming in ATS does not really stand out; it is
mostly ML-like (for functional programming) or C-like for (imperative
programming). This is a great concern to me because neither ML nor C, in my
opnion, provides a powerful high-mechanism for writing (source) code.  I do
not know how to precisely define what a high-mechanism is.  Roughly
speaking, it is some kind of feature that allows the programmer to quickly
produce code that would otherwise take much more time and effort to write.

I first turned to OOP for such a high-mechanism, but the effort did not
turn into fruition at the end. The system of function templates in ATS2 is
another effort of mine in seeking such a high-mechanism, and I hope that it
will work out this time.

PL                 High-Mechanism

C++                OOP, templates
Java               OOP, generics
Lisp               macros, meta-programming
Haskell            type-classes (monads are not)
SML/Ocaml          modules and functors
