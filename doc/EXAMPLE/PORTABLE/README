This directory contains some examples demonstrating a general
approach to generating portable C code from ATS source that can
be compiled on other platforms for which patscc is not yet installed
or even available.

Often, portable C code generated from ATS source can be compiled
by issuing the following command-line:

gcc -I${PATSHOME} -I${PATSHOME}/ccomp/runtime <some-other-flags> *_?ats.c

######

If a Makefile is used to generate C code in an example, then you
should be able to use the same Makefile to compile the generated C code.

If you use the following command-line to generate C code:

make MYPORTDIR MYPORTDIR=MYPORTDIR

then please use the the following command-line to compile the generated
C code:

make PATSCC=gcc MYCCRULE=PORTABLE -f /path/to/Makefile

It is okay to replace gcc with clang.

Note that various needed CATS-files (corresponding to header files in C)
are contained in the package ATS2-Postiats-include-xxx, where xxx is the
version number of the package. For instance, ATS2-Postiats-include-0.0.7
is available at:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/files/ats2-lang/ats2-postiats-0.0.7/

######

If you use the following command-line to generate C code:

make MYPORTDIR MYPORTCPP=MYPORTCPP

then please use the the following command-line to compile the generated
C code:

make PATSCC=gcc MYCCRULE=PORTABLE INCLUDE= -f /path/to/Makefile

There is no need for CATS-files in this case as the generated C code is
already pre-processed. However, this approach is quite limited and is not
preferred except for compiling C-files (generated from ATS source) in a
setting where ATS-includes is not available.
