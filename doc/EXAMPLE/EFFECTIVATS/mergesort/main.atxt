<h1>
Effective ATS: Mergesort
</h1>

In this article, I would like to use mergesort as a concrete example to
demonstrate a natural style of refinement-based programming.

<h2>
What is Mergesort?
</h2>

Let me answer this question by giving a specification-like implementation
of mergesort. Suppose that we have a type [myseq] declared as follows for
the data that [mergesort] is to be called on:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
abstype myseq
")</pre>

Naturally, we assign the following interface to [mergesort]:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun mergesort (xs: myseq): myseq
")</pre>

A straightforward implementation of [mergesort] can be given as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement
mergesort (xs) = let
  val n = myseq_length (xs)
in
//
  if n >= 2 then let
    val (xs1, xs2) = myseq_split (xs)
  in
    myseq_merge (mergesort (xs1), mergesort (xs2))
  end else (xs) // end of [if]
//
end // end of [mergesort]
")</pre>

where the function
[myseq_length], [myseq_split] and [myseq_merge]
are assigned the following types:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun myseq_length (xs: myseq): int
fun myseq_split (xs: myseq): (myseq, myseq)
fun myseq_merge (xs1: myseq, xs2: myseq): myseq
")</pre>

and their functionalities are briefly explained below:

<ul>
<li> [myseq_length] returns the length of a given myseq-value.
<li> [myseq_split] splits a given myseq-value into two myseq-values.
<li> [myseq_merge] merges two given sorted myseq-values into one sorted myseq-value.
</ul>

Even for someone who is unfamiliar with the syntax of ATS, it is probably
fair to say that the above specification-like implementation of [mergesort] is
often preferrable to a description of mergesort in English or other natural
langauges.

<h2>
Specifying with Dependent Types
</h2>

As the given implementation of mergesort is recursive, there must be a
reason why we expect that the implemented function [mergesort] is
terminating. Inevitably, we need to talk about the length of a myseq-value
if we argue for [mergesort] being terminating, where the length of a
myseq-value refers to the number of items contained in the sequence
represented by the myseq-value.

<p>

In ATS, we can refine [myseq] as follows by making it a type constructor
carrying one integer parameter:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
abstype myseq(n:int)
")</pre>

Given a static integer N, [myseq(N)] is for myseq-values of length N.
The type assigned to [mergesort] can be refined as follows to capture
the invariant that a given myseq-value and its sorted version have the
same length:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun mergesort{n:nat} (xs: myseq(n)): myseq(n)
")</pre>

As for the functions [myseq_length], [myseq_split]
and [myseq_merge], they can be assigned the following more informative types:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
//
fun myseq_length{n:int} (xs: myseq(n)): int(n)
//
fun myseq_split{n:int | n >= 2}
  (xs: myseq(n)): [n1,n2:pos | n1+n2==n] (myseq(n1), myseq(n2))
//
fun myseq_merge{n1,n2:nat} (xs1: myseq(n1), xs2: myseq(n2)): myseq(n1+n2)
//
")</pre>

Note that the type assigned to [myseq_split] implies that this function can
only be applied to a given myseq-value containing at least 2 items and the
two myseq-values it returns are strictly shorter than the given myseq-value.

<p>

The above implementation of [mergesort] can be slightly modified into the
following version:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement
mergesort (xs) = let
//
fun sort
  {n:nat} .<n>.
(
  xs: myseq(n)
) : myseq(n) = let
  val n = myseq_length (xs)
in
  if n >= 2 then let
    val (xs1, xs2) = myseq_split (xs)
  in
    myseq_merge (sort (xs1), sort (xs2))
  end else (xs) // end of [if]
end // end of [sort]
//
in
  sort (xs)
end // end of [mergesort]
")</pre>

Note that [sort] is verified to be terminating based on the termination
metric &lt;n&gt; (supplied by the programmer).

<p>

When trying to implement [myseq_split], we should be able to quickly
realize that the following interface is much more suitable for it:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun myseq_split{n:int | n >= 2}
  (xs: myseq(n), n: int n): (myseq(n/2), myseq(n-n/2))
")</pre>

The interface states that [myseq_split] returns a pair of myseq-values of
length n/2 and n-n/2 when applied to a myseq-value of length n and an
integer of value n. The implementation of [mergesort] can now be slightly
modified as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement
mergesort (xs) = let
//
fun sort
  {n:nat} .<n>.
(
  xs: myseq(n), n: int n
) : myseq(n) = let
in
  if n >= 2 then let
    val n2 = half (n)
    val (xs1, xs2) = myseq_split (xs, n)
  in
    myseq_merge (sort (xs1, n2), sort (xs2, n-n2))
  end else (xs) // end of [if]
end // end of [sort]
//
in
  sort (xs, myseq_length(xs))
end // end of [mergesort]
")</pre>

We now have a specification-like implementation of mergesort that
typechecks, which can be thought of as some form of blueprint intended for
implementing mergesort on concrete types such as lists and arrays.

<h2>
Mergesort on Lists
</h2>

As can be expected, the interface for mergesort on lists is given as
follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{a:t0p}
mergesort{n:nat} (xs: list (a, n)): list (a, n)
")</pre>

This interface indicates that [mergesort] is a function template
parameterized over the type of the elements in a list given as its
argument. Let us now focus on [myseq_merge], which is given the
following interface:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{a:t0p}
myseq_merge
  {n1,n2:nat}
  (xs1: list(a, n1), xs2: list(a, n2)): list(a, n1+n2)
// end of [myseq_merge]
")</pre>

Following is a straightforward implementation of [myseq_merge] on lists:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_dats("\
implement
{a}(*tmp*)
myseq_merge
  (xs10, xs20) = let
in
//
case+ xs10 of
| cons (x1, xs11) =>
  (
    case+ xs20 of
    | cons (x2, xs21) => let
        val sgn = gcompare_val<a> (x1, x2)
      in
        if sgn <= 0
          then cons{a}(x1, myseq_merge<a> (xs11, xs20))
          else cons{a}(x2, myseq_merge<a> (xs10, xs21))
        // end of [if]
      end (* end of [cons] *)
    | nil ((*void*)) => xs10
  )
| nil ((*void*)) => xs20
//
end // end of [myseq_merge]
")</pre>

Note that [gcompare_val] is a generic function template for comparing
values.

<p>

Please find the entirety of the implementation of mergesort on lists plus
some testing code in mergesort_list.dats.

<h2>
Mergesort on Arrays
</h2>

The abstract specification-like implementation of [mergesort] given above
is of so-called functional style. While it is not well-suited for
implementing mergesort on arrays (of imperative style), I would still like
to give it a try so as to make a point.

<p>

First, as an array in ATS is of C-style, there is no size information
attached to the array. So the interface for [mergesort] needs to be
modified as follows:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{a:t0p}
mergesort{n:nat} (xs: arrayref(a, n), n: int n): arrayref(a, n)
")</pre>

This interface means that [mergesort] takes both an array and the size of
the array as its two arguments.

<p>

Following is the interface for [myseq_merge] on arrays:

<pre
class="patsyntax">
#pats2xhtml_sats("\
fun{a:t0p}
myseq_merge
  {n1,n2:nat}
(
  xs1: arrayref(a, n1), xs2: arrayref(a, n2), n1: int(n1), n2: int(n2)
) : arrayref(a, n1+n2) // end of [myseq_merge]
")</pre>

There is extensive use of unsafe programming features in my implementation
of [myseq_merge] on arrays. Writing code in this way is primarily for the
purpose of saving some time as the given implementation of mergesort on
arrays is not meant for practical use; it is only meant to make a point
that the specification-like implementation of [mergesort] given above can
indeed be adapted to handle arrays.

<p>

Please find the entirety of the implementation of mergesort on arrays plus
some testing code in mergesort_array.dats.

<h2>
Refinement-based Programming
</h2>

While it may seem a bit too pedantic to implement a simple algorithm
like mergesort in the way presented above, I do hope that this style of
refinement-based programming should look obviously appealing to anyone
wanting to write even moderately complex programs. The manner in which
abstract types are supported in ATS is particularly designed under the
guideline to maximally promote refinement-based programming. As I see it,
the ability to make effective use of abstraction in controlling programming
complexity is the most important characteristic of a top programmer, and
the type system of ATS can greatly help one acquire this ability.
Have fun!
