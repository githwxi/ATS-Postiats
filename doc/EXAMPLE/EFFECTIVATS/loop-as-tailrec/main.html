<h1>
Effective ATS: Loops as Tail-Recursive Functions
</h1>

Although language constructs are available in ATS to support direct
construction of for-loops and while-loops, it is strongly recommended that
loops be implemented as tail-recursive functions (a.k.a. iterative
functions). A primary advantage of doing so is that this style of loop
implementation can be readily combined with theorem-proving as is supported
in ATS, thus facilitating program verification involving loops.

<p>

Please see tailrec.dats for the entirety of the code given in the
followng presentation.

<h2>
What is tail-recursion?
</h2>

Suppose that [foo] and [bar] are two functions and there is a call to [bar]
in the body of [foo]. This call is a tail-call if what it returns is also
the return value of [foo]. In other words, a function call in the body of
some calling function is a tail-call if the return value of the call is
also the return value of the calling function. For instance, the call to
[bar] is a tail-call in the following code but the call to [baz] is not:

<pre>
fun foo (x: int): int =
  if x > 0 then bar(x) else baz(x)+1
</pre>

By the way, even if baz(x)+1 is changed into baz(x)+0, the call to
[baz] is still not considered a tail-call unless baz(x)+0 can somehow be
translated into baz(x).

<p>

If the calling function calls itself in a tail-call, then this tail-call is
often referred to as a tail-recursive call. A function is tail-recursive if
every recursive call in its body is a tail-call. Note that a tail-recursive
function is also referred to as an iterative function in the literature.
In the following example, the outside call to [f91] is tail-recursive but
the inside one is not:

<pre>
fun f91 (x: int): int =
  if x >= 101 then x-10 else f91(f91(x+11))
</pre>

By definition, [f91] is not a tail-recursive function.

<h2>
Why is tail-recursion desirable?
</h2>

Each tail-recursive function can be readily implemented as a loop.  Assume
that a call stack is employed to implement function calls, which is by far
the most common implementation strategy in practice.  Then calling a
tail-recursive function only requires a fixed amount of stack space. In a
setting where stack space is greatly limited (e.g., low-level embedded
programming), tail-recursion is often the only form of recursion that is
legally allowed.  In short, tail-recursion is desirable because it can be
implemented in a much more efficient manner, both time-wise and
memory-wise, when compared with general recursion.

<h2>
Translating recursion into tail-recursion
</h2>

Given the advantage of tail-recursion, it is natural to encounter the need
for turning a recursive (but not tail-recursive) function into an
equivalent one that is also tail-recursive. While there is a systematic
approach to translating recursion into tail-recursion (CPS-translation),
this approach is in general not what one wants to use if one's focus is on
efficiency. Instead, one mostly relies on ad hoc methods or tricks to
handle each individual case.

<h4>
Example 1
</h4>
Let us now take a look at a concrete example. The following code implements
a function [tally] that sums up all the integers between 1 and a given
number n, inclusive:

<pre>
fun tally (n: int): int =
  if n > 0 then n + tally (n-1) else 0
</pre>

Clearly, [tally] is not tail-recursive. If we translate this implementation
of [tally] into C, we essentially obtain the following code:

<pre>
int tally (int n)
{
  return (n > 0) ? n + tally (n-1) : 0 ;
}
</pre>

This implementation of [tally] in C is a bit unusual as a standard one is
expected to be based on a for-loop:

<pre>
int tally2 (int n)
{
  int i ;
  int res = 0 ;
  for (i = n ; i > 0 ; i--) res += i ;
  return res ;
}
</pre>

It should be pointed out that the equivalence between [tally] and [tally2]
relies on the fact that integer addition is <em>associative</em>. If
addition is replaced with subtraction, which is not associative, then these
two implementations are no longer equivalent.

<p>

A straightforward translation of the above implementation of [tally2] in C
into ATS yields the following code:

<pre>
fun tally2
  (n: int): int = let
//
fun loop
  (n: int, res: int): int =
  if n > 0 then loop (n-1, res+n) else res
//
in
  loop (n, 0)
end // end of [tally2]
</pre>

Please note that the inner function [loop] is tail-recursive. The
compiler of ATS (ATS/Postiats) essentially compiles [loop] into
some code in C that is equivalent to the for-loop mentioned above.

<p>

In general, the process of translating a recursive function into a
tail-recursive one hinges on finding an efficient way to encode the stack
generated during the execution of the function. For instance, suppose we
call [tally] on 100; this call generates a recursive call on 99, and then
a recursive call on 98, and so on; when [tally] is called on 50, the call
stack essentially represents the following evaluation context:

<pre>
100 + (99 + (98 + (... + (51 + []) ...)))
</pre>

where the symbol [] is to be replaced with the return value of tally(50).
As integer addition is associative, we can use the sum (100+99+98+...+51)
to represent this evaluation context. This is precisely the idea behind the
implementation of the inner function [loop] in the body of [tally2].

<h4>
Example 2
</h4>
Let us take a look at another example. The following code implements
a function named [fib] for computing Fibonacci numbers:

<pre>
fun fib (n: int): int =
  if n >= 2 then fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) else n
</pre>

Clearly, neither of the two recursive calls in the body of [fib] is
tail-recursive. Another function named [fib2] is presented as follows for
computing Fibonacci numbers:

<pre>
fun fib2
  (n: int): int = let
//
fun loop
  (i: int, f0: int, f1: int): int =
  if i < n then loop (i+1, f1, f0+f1) else f0
//
in
  loop (0, 0, 1)
end // end of [fib2]
</pre>

It is evident that the inner funtion [loop] in the body of [fib2] is
tail-recursive. Suppose we want to evaluate fib2(100), which generates a
call of the form loop(0, 0, 1), which then generates a call of the form
loop(1, 1, 1), which then generates a call of the form loop(2, 1, 2), etc.
If loop(i, f0, f1) is among this sequence of calls, then f0 is Fibonacci
number i and f1 is Fibonacci number i+1. This implies that the value
returned by the last call in this sequence is Fibonacci number 100 (as i
reaches 100 at that point). This argument, though informal, should probably
be enough to convince one that [fib] and [fib2] are equivalent, that is,
they return the same result when applied to a given integer.

<p>

The very idea behind translating [fib] into [fib2] lies in the simple
observation that only the two previously computed Fibonacci numbers need to
be kept in order to compute Fibonacci number n for every n >= 2.

<h4>
Example 3
</h4>

The next example we see involves list-processing.
The following code implements the standard concatenation of two given
lists:

<pre>
fun
{a:t@ype}
list_append
  {m,n:nat} (
  xs: list (a, m)
, ys: list (a, n)
) : list (a, m+n) =
(
case+ xs of
| list_cons
    (x, xs) => list_cons (x, list_append (xs, ys))
| list_nil ((*void*)) => ys
) // end of [list_append]
</pre>

The type assigned to [list_append] means that the function returns a list
of length m+n when applied to two lists xs and ys of length m and n,
respectively.  Note that this is so-called functional list concatenation as
neither of the input lists gets modified. Clearly, [list_append] is not
tail-recursive as the recursive call in its body is not a tail-call. If the
first argument of a call to [list_append] is long (e.g., containing 1M
elements), then it is very likely that an execution of this call overflows
the call stack and thus causes a crash.

<p>

In order to translate [list_append] into a tail-recursive implementation,
we need some knowledge about list construction. There are essentially two
steps involved in evaluating list_cons(x, xs); certain memory needs to be
first allocated for storing a list node; then this node is initialized with
x and xs. In ATS, it is allowed to formally separate these two steps, and
this separation is key to obtaining a proper tail-recursive implementation
of list concatenation as is shown in the following code:

<pre>
fun
{a:t@ype}
list_append2
  {m,n:nat} (
  xs: list (a, m)
, ys: list (a, n)
) : list (a, m+n) = let
//
fun loop{m:nat}
(
  xs: list (a, m)
, ys: list (a, n)
, res: &ptr? >> list (a, m+n)
) : void =
(
case+ xs of
| list_cons
    (x, xs1) => let
    val () = // allocate a list node with
    res := list_cons{a}{0}(x, _) // uninitialized tail
    val+list_cons (_, res1) = res // [res1] points to the tail
    // put into [res1] the concatenation
    val () = loop (xs1, ys, res1) // of [xs1] and [ys]
  in
    fold@(res) // folding translates into a no-op at run-time
  end // end of [list_cons]
| list_nil ((*void*)) => res := ys
)
//
var res: ptr
val () = loop (xs, ys, res)
//
in
  res
end // end of [list_append2]
</pre>

Given xs, ys, and res, what the inner function [loop] does is to put the
concatenation of xs and ys into res.  In the body of [loop], we see that
the expression fold@(res) follows the recursive call to [loop].  However,
this call is considered a tail-call as fold@(res) is solely used for the
purpose of typechecking and erased afterwards.  Therefore, [loop] is a
tail-recursive function.

<p>

By the way, the style of recursion employed in the implementation of [loop]
is often dubbed <em>tail-recursion modulo allocation</em>, which commonly
appears in untyped or weakly-typed languages (e.g., LISP and C) but rarely
in a typed language (due to the great difficulty in properly typing it).

<h2>
Mutually tail-recursive functions
</h2>

Sometimes, we need to combine functions together in order to turn mutully
tail-recursive calls into local jumps. For instance, in the following code,
[isevn] and [isodd] are defined mutually recursively:

<pre>
fun isevn (n: int): bool =
  if n > 0 then isodd (n-1) else true
and isodd (n: int): bool =
  if n > 0 then isevn (n-1) else false
</pre>

The call to [isodd] in the body of [isevn] and the call to [isevn] in the
body of [isadd] are both tail-calls. As they are also mutually recursive
calls, they are referred to as mutually tail-recursive calls.

<p>

When compiling this implementation of [isevn] and [isadd], the ATS compiler
(ATS/Postiats) handles [isevn] and [isodd] separately and thus
is <em>unable</em> to turn the call to [isodd] ([isevn]) in the body of
[isevn] ([isodd]) into a local jump. In order to indicate to the compiler
that these two functions need to be combined for compilation, the keyword
[fun] should be replaced with another keyword [fnx]:

<pre>
fnx isevn (n: int): bool =
  if n > 0 then isodd (n-1) else true
and isodd (n: int): bool =
  if n > 0 then isevn (n-1) else false
</pre>

When compiling the above code, the ATS compiler puts inside the body of
[isevn] a copy of the body of [isodd] so that mutually tail-recursive calls
in the bodies of these two functions can be translated into local jumps.
Also, please note that only the first of a sequence of mutually defined
functions following the keyword [fnx] is available for subsequent use. In
the above case, only the function [isevn] is available for subsequent use
whereas the function [isodd] is not.
