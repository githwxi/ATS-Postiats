# Crash into [ATS](http://www.ats-lang.org/)

HX-2017-06-02:

I have long been wanting to write a set of notes on functional
programming in ATS. Hopefully, I will be able to carry out the task
this time :)

My current plan is to present a crash course on functional programming
that targets someone who has already acquired certain basic
understanding of programming in general (e.g., someone who has
already done a bit of programming that is roughly equivalent to taking
one semester of an introductory programming course based on C, Java or
Python). This crash course is primarily based on the ML-like
functional core of ATS extended with templates (for handling
parametric polymorphism), and the presented style of functional
programming makes extensive use of combinators (which are mostly
simple list-processing and stream-processing functions).
