#para('\

ATS and C share precisely the same native/flat/unboxed data representation.
As a consequence, there is no need for wrapping/unwrapping or
boxing/unboxing when calling from C a function implemented in ATS or vice
versa, and there is also no run-time overhead for doing so. To a large
extent, ATS can be considered a front-end to C that is equipped with a
highly expressive type system (for specifying program invariants) and a
highly adaptable template system (for facilitating code reuse). In
particular, ATS can often be effectively employed to turn a large task into
subtasks of coherent interfaces, which can be implemented in ATS, C or some
other langauges and then assembled together to form a solution to the orginal
task.\

')

#para('\

As can be expected, C code that appears directly in ATS does not go
through the kind of rigorous typechecking like ATS code should. So it is
recommended that the programmer be extra cautious when making direct use of
C code inside ATS code. In practice, my own experience clearly indicates
that the portion of C code inside my ATS code is highly likely to be the
culprit for most of encountered bugs.

#para("\

A function declared in ATS can be given a global name of C-style so as to
allow the function to appear in both ATS code and C code.  In particular,
the function can be implemented in ATS and called in C or vice versa.\

")

#para("\

In the following code, we see that two functions are declared:

#atscode('\
extern
fun fact (n: int): int
extern
fun fact2 (n: int, res: int): int = "ext\#fact2_in_c"
')

The first function #dyncode("fact") does not have a global name while the
second function #dyncode("fact2") is assigned a global name
#dyncode("fact2_in_c").  The symbol #keycode("ext\#") indicates that
#dyncode("fact2_in_c") is treated as a global function in C and its
prototype needs to be declared (via the #dyncode("extern") keyword) before
it can be called. If #keycode("ext\#") is written in place of
#keycode("ext\#fact2_in_c") in the above declaration, then the global name
for the function #dyncode("fact2") in ATS is assumed to be same as the name
of the function in ATS. In other words, writing #keycode("ext\#") in the
above declaration is equivalent to writing #keycode("ext\#fact2").

")

#para("\

Let us assume that #dyncode("fact") can be implemented as follows:

#atscode('\
implement fact (n) = fact2 (n, 1)
')

When compiling this implementation, the ATS compiler needs to form function
names in the generated C code to refer to #dyncode("fact") and
#dyncode("fact2").  For the former, the function name in the C code is
determined by a set of rules (which take into account the issue of
namespace).  For the latter, the function name is simply chosen to be the
assigned global name #dyncode("fact2_in_c"). As is suggested by the name of
#dyncode("fact2_in_c"), this function can be directly implemented in C as
follows:

<informalexample><programlisting>
<![CDATA[int
fact2_in_c (int n, int res)
{
  while (n > 0) { res *= n ; n -= 1 ; } ; return res ;
}
]]></programlisting></informalexample>

It is also allowed to implement #dyncode("fact2") in ATS
directly as is shown below:

#atscode('\
implement
fact2 (n, res) = if n > 0 then fact2 (n-1, n*res) else res
')

This implementation of #dyncode("fact2") can be called in C
through the name #dyncode("fact2_in_c").\

")

#para('\

If both #dyncode("fact2") and #dyncode("fact2_in_c") are implemented (the
former in ATS and the latter in C), then a link-time error is to be
issued to indicate that #dyncode("fact2_in_c") is implemented repeatedly.\

')

#para('\

One can also declare #dyncode("fact2") as follows:

#atscode('\
extern
fun fact2 (n: int, res: int): int = "mac\#fact2_in_c"
')

The symbol #keycode("mac\#") indicates that #dyncode("fact2_in_c") is
treated like a macro in C. In particular, #dyncode("fact2_in_c") can be
called without its prototype being declared first. As a matter of fact, it
may not even have a prototype. This style of declaration naturally expects
#dyncode("fact2_in_c") to be implemented in C directly.\

')

#para('\

It is also allowed to use #keycode("sta\#") in place of #keycode("mac\#"):

#atscode('\
extern
fun fact2 (n: int, res: int): int = "sta\#fact2_in_c"
')

If declared in this style, which only occurs rarely in practice,
then #dyncode("fact2_in_c") is treated like a static function in C.\

')

#para('\

For the sake of completeness, I mention as follows another way of declaring
a static function:

#atscode('\
static fun fact2 (n: int, res: int): int
')

This style of declaration is automatically translated into the following one:

#atscode('\
extern fun fact2 (n: int, res: int): int = "sta\#"
')

where the use of #keycode("sta\#") means that the name referring to #dyncode("fact2")
in C is simply #dyncode("fact2").\

External types and values can be readily formed in ATS to refer to types

#para("\

Suppose that there is a type in C of the name #stacode("some_type_in_c"),
then this type can be referred to in ATS as
#stacode('$extype"some_type_in_c"'). For instance, type definitions are
introduced in the following code for some external types in C:

#atscode('\
typedef Cint = $extype"int"
typedef Clint = $extype"long int"
typedef Cllint = $extype"long long int"
typedef Cint2 = $extype"struct{ int x; int y; }"

Suppose that there is a value in C of the name #dyncode("some_value_in_c"),
then this value can be referred to in ATS as #dyncode('$extval(#stacode('T'), "some_value_in_c")'),
where T is a type in ATS assigned to this value.  For instance, macro
definitions are introduced in the following code for some external values
in C:

#atscode('\
macdef NULL = $extval(ptr, "0")
macdef stdin_ref = $extval(FILEref, "stdin")
macdef stdout_ref = $extval(FILEref, "stdout")

External values can also be formed to refer to functions in C as done
in the following code:

#atscode('\
macdef atoi = $extval(string -> int, "atoi")
macdef atol = $extval(string -> lint, "atol")
macdef atof = $extval(string -> double, "atof")
')

Note that there are other ways in ATS that are often more approriate for
directly referring to functions in C.  Typically, the primary purpose of
forming an external value in ATS is to allow a constant declared in C to be
directly referred to in ATS code.

Just like including assembly code inside C code, it is straightforward to
include C code inside ATS code. For instance, the example appearing at the
beginning of this chapter can be written as follows in a single file:

For C code to appear inside ATS code, it needs to enclosed by the symbols
#keycode("%{") (opening) and #keycode("%}") (closing). Essentially,
whatever code appearing between these two symbols is pasted into the
generated C code at an unspecified position. If the enclosed code is
intended to be put at the beginning of the generated C code, then the
symbol #keycode("%{^") should be used in place of #keycode("%{").  If the
enclosed code is intended to be put at the bottom of the generated C code,
then the symbol #keycode("%{$") should be used in place of #keycode("%{").

#para('\

It is also allowed to put C code between the symbols
#keycode("%{#") and #keycode("%}"). Suppose that there is a file of the
name #filename("foo.sats") that contains C code included in this manner.
If #filename("foo.sats") is staloaded in another file of the name
#filename("foo.dats"), then the lines between #keycode("%{#") and

ATS is probably not a programming language easy for one to write code in.
While ATS provides many features to support safe (low-level) programming,
it may take a long time and some great efforts for a programmer to learn
and then master these features before he or she can make effective use of
them.  In this section, I would like to present some ATS code written in
C-style that makes typical use of certan unsafe programming features in
ATS. This is a programming style that should be familiar to any programmer

There are always occasions where one may find it sensible to program in
unsafe C-style. Sometimes, one just wants to get a running implementation
and then relies on testing to detect and fix bugs. Sometimes, one simply
does not know enough of ATS needed to implement a function in a safe
programming manner. This list of occasions can be readily extended as one
wishes. I myself do unsafe C-style programming in ATS frequently, and I see
it as a necessary skill for anyone who not just only wants to be able to
write code in ATS but also wants to do it highly productively. Let us now
see a concrete example of unsafe C-style programming in ATS.

#para("\

Suppose that we want to implement a function for comparing two given
strings according to the standard lexicographic ordering. Let us name
the function #dyncode("strcmp") and give it the following interface:

#atscode('\
fun strcmp (str1: string, str2: string): int
')

Given two strings #dyncode("str1") and #dyncode("str2"),
#dyncode("strcmp(str1, str2)") is expected to return 1, -1, and 0 if
#dyncode("str1") is greater than, less than, and equal to #dyncode("str2"),
respectively. An implementation of #dyncode("strcmp") is given as follows:

#atscode('\

For a programmer familar with C, the above implementation of
#dyncode("strcmp") should be easily accessible.  There are a variety of
unsafe functions declared in #myatscodelink("prelude/SATS/unsafe.sats",
"unsafe.sats"). Given a type T and a pointer p, #dyncode("ptr0_get&lt;T&gt;
(p)") fetches the value of the type T stored at the location to which p
points.  Note that #dyncode("ptr0_get") is inherently unsafe as there is
simply no guarantee that p actually points to a valid memory location where
a value of the type T is stored.  The function #dyncode("cast"), which is
also inherently unsafe, casts the type of a given value into any chosen
type.  The function template #dyncode("ptr0_succ"), which is declared in
#myatscodelink("prelude/SATS/pointer.sats", "pointer.sats"), is
type-safe. Given a type T, #dyncode("ptr0_succ&lt;T&gt; (p)") returns the
pointer that is n bytes after p, where n equals the size of T.

For a function like #dyncode("strcmp"), one can readily implement it in C

However, writing ATS code in C-style can often have advantages over writing
C code directly. For instance, there is direct support in ATS but not in C
for implementing function templates.  In C, one is essentially forced to
rely on rather involved use of macros to implement function templates,
which makes the code not only difficult to follow but also notoriously
error-prone. Let us now see as follows a function template implementation

There is also support in ATS for exporting types to make them available for
use in C directly. In the following example, a typedef of the name

#atscode('\
extern
typedef

Essentially, #stacode("int_and_string") is defined in C as follows:

constructor is created whose name equals the concatenation of the name of
the data constructor and the string "_pstruct". So in the case of the above
declared datatype #stacode("abc"), the type constructors
#stacode("cons1_pstruct") and #stacode("cons2_pstruct") are created, and
these type constructors can be used to form types for boxed values
constructed with the data constructors #dyncode("cons1") and #dyncode("cons2").

In the following declaration,
the type #stacode("cons2_pstruct(int, double)") in ATS

Implicitly, a typedef in C of the name #stacode("cons2_node_") is also
introduced for the unboxed portion of a value constructed with the data

  p->contag = 1 ;
  p->atslab__0 = i ;
  p->atslab__1 = d ;

second constructors associated with the datatype #stacode("abc").

In order to statically allocate memory for list-nodes, we need to first
form a type for list-nodes so that we can inform the C compiler how
