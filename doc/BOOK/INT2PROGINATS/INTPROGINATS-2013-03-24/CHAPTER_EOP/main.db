<title>Elements of Programming</title>

<para>The core of ATS is a call-by-value functional programming language. I will
explain the meaning of <emphasis>call-by-value</emphasis> in a moment. As
for functional programming, there is really no precise definition.  The
most important aspect of functional programming that I want to explore is
the notion of binding, which relates names to expressions.</para>

<sect1 id="expressions_and_values">
<title>Expressions and Values</title>

<para>ATS is feature-rich, and its grammar is probably more complex than
most existing programming languages. In ATS, there are a large variety of
forms of expressions, which I will introduce gradually.</para>

<para>Let us first start with some integer arithmetic expressions (IAEs):
<code>1</code>, <code>~2</code>, <code>1+2</code>, <code>1+2*3-4</code>,
<code>(1+2)/(3-4)</code>, etc. Note that the negative sign is represented by
the tilde symbol (<code>~</code>) in ATS.  There is also support for
floating point numbers, and some floating point constants are given here:
<code>1.0</code>, <code>~2.0</code>, <code>3.</code>, <code>0.12345</code>,
<code>2.71828</code>, <code>31416E-4</code>, etc. Note that <code>3.</code>
and <code>31416E-4</code> are the same as <code>3.0</code> and
<code>3.1416</code>, respectively. What I really want to emphasize at this
point is that <code>1</code> and <code>1.0</code> are two distinct numbers
in ATS: the former is an integer while the latter is a floating point
number.</para>

<para>There are also boolean constants: <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.  We can
form boolean expressions such as <code>1 >= 0</code>, <code>not(2-1 >= 2)</code>,
<code>(1 < 2) andalso (2 < 3)</code> and <code>(~1 > 1) orelse (~1 <= 1)</code>,
where <code>not</code>, <code>andalso</code> and <code>orelse</code> stand for
negation, conjunction and disjunction, respectively.</para>

<para>
Other commonly used constant values include characters and strings.
For instance, here are some character constants: <code>'a'</code>,
<code>'B'</code>, <code>'\n'</code> (newline), <code>'\t'</code> (tab),
<code>'\('</code> (left parenthesis), <code>')'</code> (right parenthesis),
<code>'\{'</code> (left curly brace), <code>'}'</code> (right curly brace),
etc; here are some string constants: <code>"My name is Zoe"</code>,
<code>"Don't call me \"Cloe\""</code>, <code>"this is a newline:\n"</code>,
etc.
</para>

<para>Given a (function) name, say, foo, and an expression exp, the
expression foo(exp) is a function application or function call. The
parentheses in foo(exp) may be dropped if no ambiguity is created by doing
so. For instance, <code>print("Hello")</code> is a function application,
which can also be written as <code>print "Hello"</code>.  If foo is a
nullary function, then a function application foo() can be formed.  If foo
is a binary function, then a function application foo(exp1, exp2) can be
formed for expressions exp1 and exp2. Functions of more arguments can be
treated accordingly.</para>

<para>Note that we cannot write <code>+(1,2)</code> as the name
<code>+</code> has already been given the infix status requiring that it be
treated as an infix operator.  However, we can write <code>op+(1,2)</code>,
where <code>op</code> is a keyword in ATS that can be used to temporarily
suspend the infix status of any name immediately following it. I will
explain in detail the issue of fixity (prefix, infix and postfix)
elsewhere.</para>

<para>Values are essentially expressions of certain special forms, which
can not be reduced or simplified further. For instance, integer constants
such as <code>1</code> and <code>~2</code> are values, but the integer
expression <code>1+2</code> is not a value, which can be reduced to the
value <code>3</code>.  Evaluation refers to the computational process that
reduces a given expression into a value. However, certain expressions such
as <code>1/0</code> cannot be reduced to a value, and evaluating such an
expression must abort at some point. I will gradually present more
information on evaluation.</para>

<sect1 id="names_and_bindings">
<title>Names and Bindings</title>

<para>A crucial aspect of a programming language is the mechanism it
provides for binding names, which are themselves expressions, to
expressions. For instance, a declaration is introduced by the following
syntax that declares a binding between the name <code>x</code>, which is
also referred to as a variable, and the expression <code>1+2</code>:</para>

<informalexample><programlisting>
val x = 1 + 2
</programlisting></informalexample>

<para>Note that <code>val</code> is a keyword in ATS, and the declaration is
classified as a val-declaration. Conceptually, what happens at run-time in
a call-by-value language such as ATS is that the expression
<code>1+2</code> is first evaluated to the value <code>3</code>, and then
the binding between <code>x</code> and <code>1+2</code> is
<emphasis>finalized</emphasis> into a binding between <code>x</code> and
<code>3</code>. Essentially, call-by-value means that a binding between a
name and an expression needs to be finalized into one between the name and
the value of the expression before it can be used in evaluation
subsequently. As another example, the following syntax declares three
bindings, two of which are formed simultaneously in the first line:</para>

<informalexample><programlisting>
val PI = 3.14 and radius = 10.0
val area = PI * radius * radius
</programlisting></informalexample>

<para>Note that it is unspecified in ATS as to which of the first two bindings
is finalized ahead of the other at run-time. However, it is guaranteed that
the third binding is finalized after the first two are done.</para>

</sect1><!--id="names_and_bindings"-->

<!-- ****** ****** -->

<sect1 id="scopes_for_bindings">
<title>Scopes for Bindings</title>

<para>Each binding is given a fixed scope in which the binding is
considered legal or effective. The scope of a toplevel binding in a file
starts from the point where the binding is introduced until the very end of
the file. The bindings introduced in the following example between the
keywords <code>let</code> and <code>in</code> are effective until the
keyword <code>end</code> is reached:</para>

<informalexample><programlisting>
val area = let
  val PI = 3.14 and radius = 10.0 in PI * radius * radius
end // end of [let]
</programlisting></informalexample>

<para>Such bindings are referred to as local bindings, and the names such as
<code>PI</code> and <code>radius</code> are referred to as local names.
This example can also be written in the following style:</para>

<informalexample><programlisting>
val area =
  PI * radius * radius where {
  val PI = 3.14 and radius = 10.0 // simultaneous bindings
} // end of [where]
</programlisting></informalexample>

<para>The keyword <code>where</code> appearing immediately after an expression
introduces bindings that are solely effective for evaluating names
contained in the expression.  Note that expressions formed using the
keywords <code>let</code> and <code>where</code> are often referred to as
let-expressions and where-expressions, respectively. The former can always
be translated into the latter directly and vice versa.  Which style is
better? I have not formed my opinion yet. The answer seems to entirely
depend on the taste of the programmer.</para>

<para>The following example demonstrates an alternative approach to introducing
local bindings:

<informalexample><programlisting>
local

val PI = 3.14 and radius = 10.0

in

val area = PI * radius * radius

end // end of [local]
</programlisting></informalexample>

where the bindings introduced between the keywords <code>local</code> and
<code>in</code> are effective until the keyword <code>end</code> is
reached. Note that the bindings introduced between the keywords
<code>in</code> and <code>end</code> are themselves toplevel bindings. The
difference between <code>let</code> and <code>local</code> should be clear:
The former is used to form an expression while the latter is used to
introduce a sequence of declarations.</para>

<sect1 id="environments_for_evaluation">
<title>Environments for Evaluation</title>

<para>Evaluation is the computational process that reduces expressions to
values.  When performing evaluation, we need not only the expression to be
evaluated but also a collection of bindings that map names in the
expression to values. This collection of bindings, which is just a finite
mapping, is often referred to as an environment (for evaluation). For
instance, suppose that we want to evaluate the following expression:

<informalexample><programlisting>
let
  val PI = 3.14 and radius2 = 10.0 * 10.0 in PI * radius2
end
</programlisting></informalexample>

We start with the empty environment ENV0; we evaluate <code>3.14</code> to
itself and <code>10.0 * 10.0</code> to <code>100.0</code> under the
environment ENV0; we then extend ENV0 to ENV1 with two bindings mapping
<code>PI</code> to <code>3.14</code> and <code>radius2</code> to
<code>100.0</code>; we then evaluate <code>PI * radius2</code> under ENV1
to <code>3.14 * radius2</code>, then to <code>3.14 * 100.0</code>, and
finally to <code>314.0</code>, which is the value of the let-expression.</para>

<sect1 id="static_semantics">
<title>Static Semantics</title>

<para>ATS is a programming language equipped with a highly expressive type
system rooted in the <emphasis>Applied Type System</emphasis> framework,
which also gives ATS its name. I will gradually introduce the type system
of ATS, which is probably the most outstanding and interesting part of this
book.</para>

<para>It is common to treat a type as the set of values it classifies.
However, I find it more approriate to treat a type as a form of
meaning. There are formal rules for assigning types to expressions, which
are referred to as typing rules.  If a type T can be assigned to an
expression, then I say that the expression possesses the static meaning
(semantics) represented by the type T. Note that an expression may be
assigned many distinct static meanings.  An expression is well-typed if
there exists a type T such that the expression can be assigned the type T.</para>

<para>If there is a binding between a name and an expression and the
expression is of some type T, then the name is assumed to be of the type T
in the effective scope of the binding. In other words, the name assumes the
static meaning of the expression it refers to.</para>

<para>Let exp0 be an expression of some type T, that is, the type T can be
assigned to exp0 according to the typing rules. If we can evaluate exp0 to
exp1, then exp1 can also be assigned the type T. In other words, static
meaning is an invariant under evaluation. This property is often referred
to as <emphasis>type preservation</emphasis>, which is part of the
soundness of the type system of ATS. Based on this property, we can readily
infer that any value is of the type T if exp0 can be evaluated to it (in
many steps).</para>

<para>Let exp0 be an expression of some type T. Assume that exp0 is not a
value.  Then exp0 can always be evaluated one step further to another
expression exp1. This property is often referred to
as <emphasis>progress</emphasis>, which is another part of the soundness of
the type system of ATS.</para>

</sect1><!--id="static_semantics"-->

<sect1 id="primitive_types">
<title>Primitive Types</title>

<para>The simplest types in ATS are primitive types, which are used to
classify primitive values. For instance, we have the primitive types
<code>int</code> and <code>double</code>, which classify integers (in a
fixed range) and floating point numbers (of double precision),
respectively.</para>

<para>In the current implementation of ATS (Anairiats), a program in ATS
is first compiled into one in C, which can then be compiled to object code
by a compiler for C such as gcc. In the compilation from ATS to C, the type
<code>int</code> in ATS is translated to the type of the same name in
C. Similarly, the type <code>double</code> in ATS is translated to
the type of the same name in C.</para>

<para>There are many other primitive types in ATS, and I will introduce
them gradually.  Some commonly used primitive types are listed as follows:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem>
<para><code>bool</code>:
This type is for boolean values <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>char</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for characters.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>schar</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for signed characters.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>uchar</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for unsigned characters.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>float</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for floating point numbers of
single precision.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>uint</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for unsigned integers.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>lint</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for long integers.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>ulint</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for unsigned long integers.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>llint</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for long long integers.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>ullint</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C for unsigned long long integers.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>size_t</code>:
This type is translated into the type in C of the same name, which is for
unsigned integers of certain precision.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>string</code>: This type is for strings, and its translation in C is
the type void* (for pointers). I will explain this translation elsewhere.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<para><code>void</code>: This type is for the void value, and its translation in C
is the type void. It should be noted that the void value is unspecified in
ATS. I often say that a function returns no value if it returns the void
value, and vice versa.</para>
</listitem>

</itemizedlist>

I will gradually present programming examples involving various primitive types and
values.</para>

<sect1 id="tuples_and_tuple_types">
<title>Tuples and Tuple Types</title>

<para>Given two types T1 and T2, we can form a tuple type (T1, T2), which
can also be written as @(T1, T2).  Assume that exp1
and exp2 are two expressions of the types T1 and T2,
respectively. Then the expression (exp1,
exp2), which can also be written as
@(exp1, exp2), refers to a
tuple of the tuple type (T1, T2). Accordingly, we can form tuples and tuple
types of more components. In order for a tuple type to be assigned to a
tuple, the tuple and tuple type must have the equal number of components.</para>

<para>When evaluating a tuple expression, we evaluate all of its
components <emphasis>sequentially</emphasis>. Suppose that the expression
contains n components, then the value of the expression is the tuple
consisting of the n values of the n components listed in the order as the
components themselves.</para>

<para>A tuple of length n for n >= 2 is just a record of field names
ranging from 0 until n-1, inclusively. Given an expression exp of some
tuple type (T1, T2), we can form expressions (exp).0 and (exp).1, which are
of types T1 and T2, respectively. Note that the expression exp does not
have to be a tuple expression. For instance, exp may be a name or a
function application. If exp evaluates to a tuple of two values, then exp.0
evaluates to the first value and exp.1 the second value. Clearly, if the
tuple type of exp contains more components, what is stated can be
generalized accordingly.</para>

<para>In the following example, we first construct a tuple of length 3 and
then introduce bindings between 3 names and all of the 3 components of the
tuple:

<informalexample><programlisting>
val xyz = ('A', 1, 2.0)
val x = xyz.0 and y = xyz.1 and z = xyz.2
</programlisting></informalexample>

Note that the constructed tuple can be assigned the tuple type
<code>(char, int, double)</code>. Another method for selecting components
in a given tuple is based on pattern matching, which is employed in the
following example:

<informalexample><programlisting>
val xyz = ('A', 1, 2.0)
val (x, y, z) = xyz // x = 'A'; y = 1; z = 2.0
</programlisting></informalexample>

Note that <code>(x, y, z)</code> is a pattern that can match any tuples of
exact 3 components. I will say more about pattern matching elsewhere.
</para>

<para>The tuples introduced above are often referred to as flat tuples, native
tuples or unboxed tuples. There is another kind of tuples supported in ATS,
which are called boxed tuples. A boxed tuple is essentially a pointer
pointing to some heap location where a flat tuple is stored.</para>

<para>Assume that exp1 and exp2 are
two expressions of the types T1 and T2, respectively. Then the expression
'(exp1, exp2), refers to a
tuple of the tuple type '(T1, T2). Accordingly, we can form boxed tuples
and boxed tuple types of fewer or more components. What should be noted
immediately is that every boxed tuple is of the size of a pointer, and can
thus be stored in any place where a pointer can. Using boxed tuples is
rather similar to using unboxed ones. For instance, the meaning of the
following code should be evident:

<informalexample><programlisting>
val xyz = '( 'A', 1, 2.0 )
val x = xyz.0 and y = xyz.1 and z = xyz.2
</programlisting></informalexample>

Note that a space is needed between <code>'(</code> and <code>'A'</code>
for otherwise the current parser (for Anairiats) would be confused.</para>

<para>Given the availability of flat and boxed tuples, one naturally wants
to know whether there is a simple way to determine which kind is preferred
over the other. Unfortunately, there is no simple way to do this as far as I
can tell. In order to be certain, some kind of profiling is often
needed. However, if we want to run code with no support of garbage collection
(GC), then we should definitely avoid using boxed tuples.</para>

</sect1><!--id="tuples_and_tuple_types"-->

<!-- ****** ****** -->

<sect1 id="records_and_record_types">
<title>Records and Record Types</title>

<para>A record is just like a tuple except that each field name of the
record is chosen by the programmer (instead of being fixed). Similarly, a
record type is just like a tuple type.  For instance, a record type
<code>point2D</code> is defined as follows:

<informalexample><programlisting>
typedef point2D = @{ x= double, y= double }
</programlisting></informalexample>

where <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are the names of the two fields in
a record value of this type. We also refer to a field in a record as a
component. The special symbol <code>@{</code> indicates that the formed
type is for flat/native/unboxed records. A value of the type
<code>point2D</code> is constructed as follows and given the name
<code>theOrigin</code>:

<informalexample><programlisting>
val theOrigin = @{ x= 0.0, y= 0.0 } : point2D
</programlisting></informalexample>
</para>

<para>We can use the standard dot notation to extract out a selected component in
a record, and this is shown in the next line of code:

<informalexample><programlisting>
val theOrigin_x = theOrigin.x and theOrigin_y = theOrigin.y
</programlisting></informalexample>

Alternatively, we can use pattern matching for doing component extraction
as is done in the next line of code:

<informalexample><programlisting>
val @{ x= theOrigin_x, y= theOrigin_y } = theOrigin
</programlisting></informalexample>

In this case, the names <code>theOrigin_x</code> and
<code>theOrigin_y</code> are bound to the components in
<code>theOrgin</code> that are named <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>,
respectively. If we only need to extract out a selected few of components
(instead of all the available ones), we can make use of the following
kind of patterns:

<informalexample><programlisting>
val @{ x= theOrigin_x, ... } = theOrigin // the x-component only 
val @{ y= theOrigin_y, ... } = theOrigin // the y-component only 
</programlisting></informalexample>

If you find all this syntax for component extraction to be confusing, then
I suggest that you stick to the dot notation. I myself rarely use pattern
matching on record values.
</para>

<para>Compared with handling native/flat/unboxed records, the only change
needed for handling boxed records is to replace the special symbol
<code>@{</code> with another one: <code>'{</code>, which is a quote
followed immediately by a left curly brace.</para>

</sect1><!--id="records_and_record_types"-->

<!-- ****** ****** -->

<sect1 id="conditional_expressions">
<title>Conditional Expressions</title>

<para>A conditional expression consists of a test and two branches. For instance,
the following expression is conditional:

<informalexample><programlisting>
if (x >= 0) then x else ~x
</programlisting></informalexample>

where <code>if</code>, <code>then</code> and <code>else</code> are keywords
in ATS. In a conditional expression, the expression following
<code>if</code> is the test and the expressions following <code>then</code>
and <code>else</code> are referred to as the then-branch and the
else-branch (of the conditional expression), respectively.
</para>

<para>In order to assign a type T to a conditional expression, we need to
assign the type <code>bool</code> to the test and the type T to both of the
then-branch and the else-branch. For instance, the type <code>int</code>
can be assigned to the above conditional expression if the name
<code>x</code> is given the type <code>int</code>. One may think that the
following conditional expression is ill-typed, that is, it cannot be given
type:

<informalexample><programlisting>
if (x >= 0) then '0' else 1 // this expression can be given a type!
</programlisting></informalexample>

Actually, it is possible to find a type T in ATS that can be assigned to
the conditional expression. I will explain the reason for this elsewhere.
</para>

<para>Suppose that we have a conditional expression that is
well-typed. When evaluating it, we first evaluate the test to a value,
which is guaranteed to be either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>;
if the value is <code>true</code>, then we continue to evaluate the
then-branch; otherwise, we continue to evaluate the else-branch.
</para>

<para>It is also allowed to form a conditional expression where the else-branch
is truncated. For instance, we can form something as follows:

<informalexample><programlisting>
if (x >= 0) then print(x)
</programlisting></informalexample>

which is equivalent to the following conditional expression:

<informalexample><programlisting>
if (x >= 0) then print(x) else ()
</programlisting></informalexample>

Note that <code>()</code> stands for the void value (of the type
<code>void</code>). If a type can be assigned to a conditional expression
in the truncated form, then the type must be <code>void</code>.</para>

</sect1><!--id="conditional_expressions"-->

<!-- ****** ****** -->

<sect1 id="sequence_expressions">
<title>Sequence Expressions</title>

<para>Assume that exp1 and exp2 are expressions of types T1 and T2
respectively, where T1 is <code>void</code>. Then a sequence expression
(exp1; exp2) can be formed that is of the type T2.  When evaluating the
sequence expression (exp1; exp2), we first evaluate exp1 to the void value
and then evaluate exp2 to some value, which is also the value of the
sequence expression.  When more expressions are sequenced, all of them but
the last one need to be of the type <code>void</code> and the type of the
last expression is also the type of the sequence expression being formed.
Evaluating a sequence of more expressions is analogous to evaluating a
sequence of two. The following example is a sequence expression:
 
<informalexample><programlisting>
(print 'H'; print 'e'; print 'l'; print 'l'; print 'o')
</programlisting></informalexample>

Evaluating this sequence expression prints out (onto the console) the
5-letter string "Hello". Instead of parentheses, we can also use the
keywords <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> to form a sequence
expression:

<informalexample><programlisting>
begin
  print 'H'; print 'e'; print 'l'; print 'l'; print 'o'
end // end of [begin]
</programlisting></informalexample>

If we like, we may also add a semicolon immediately after the last
expression in a sequence as long as the last expression is of the type
<code>void</code>. For instance, the above example can also be written as
follows:

<informalexample><programlisting>
begin
  print 'H'; print 'e'; print 'l'; print 'l'; print 'o';
end // end of [begin]
</programlisting></informalexample>

I also want to point out the following style of sequencing:

<informalexample><programlisting>
let
  val () = print 'H'
  val () = print 'e'
  val () = print 'l'
  val () = print 'l'
  val () = print 'o'
in
  // nothing
end // end of [begin]
</programlisting></informalexample>

which is rather common in functional programming.</para>
