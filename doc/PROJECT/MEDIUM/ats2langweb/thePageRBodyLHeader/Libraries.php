ATS is feature-rich. It can accommodate low-level C-style imperative
programming as well as high-level ML-style functional programming. In
addition, it supports an advanced template system, which is comparable
to the one in C++.
As different programming styles often require different kinds of library
support, it is probably unsurprising that there are several varieties of
libraries in ATS available to meet certain distinct needs of programmers
(such as a runtime with or without GC).
