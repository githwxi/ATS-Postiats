ATS is feature-rich. It can accommodate low-level C-style imperative
programming as well as high-level ML-style functional programming. In
addition, it supports an advanced template system comparable to the
one in C++.  As different programming styles often require different
kinds of library support, it is probably unsurprising that there are
several varieties of libraries in ATS available to meet certain
distinct needs of programmers (such as a runtime with or without GC).
