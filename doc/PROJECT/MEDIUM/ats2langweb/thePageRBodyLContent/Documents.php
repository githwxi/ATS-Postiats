<h2><a id="#INT2PROGINATS">Introduction to Programming in ATS</a></h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td>
This book starts from the core of ATS, a statically typed call-by-value
functional programming language, gradually introducing the reader to
dependent types, linear types and the paradigm of programming with
theorem-proving. It assumes no familiarity of the reader with functional
programming but it does expect the reader to have already acquired
basic understanding of programming and possibly some programming skills.

<h2><a id="#TUT2PROGINATS">A Tutorial on Programming Features in ATS</a></h2>

<table>
<tr><td>
The primary purpose of this tutorial is to bring deep insights into a rich
set of programming features in ATS and also demonstrate through concrete
examples that these features can be made of effective use in the
construction of high-quality programs. For someone familiar with both ML
and C, it is possible to learn programming in ATS by simply studying the
tutorial. However, a coherent and systematic view of ATS is diffcult to be
gained from the tutorial alone.
