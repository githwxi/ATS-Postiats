TODO:

Focus on the gurobi (LP) solver first. This is not free for industry use, but
it is a very good solver with a documented C API and quite a few featurs.
Therfore, it should be good to work with while designing abract interfaces.
(Also, I am most familiar with this solver).

Afterwards, add support for similar free solvers (COIN-OR and GLPK for instance).


*** Types ***

Think we should use built-in gvectors or gmatrix.
It looks like gurobi expects c-arrays so just need to cast these
when passed.

Problems (models):
 - Size of vectors, check that they are of consistent size.


Solutions:
Returned vector should be embedded in an option or some other data(v)type
that describes the solution status, or whether there is a solution at all.


*** Linear Type considerations ***
GRBaddconstr, etc: just need to make sure the model pointer has the correct view,
i.e., that it has been initialized and has the correct type.
