ATSOptML, pronounced "ats optimal", are resources for optimization and
machine learning.
 
These are primarily designed to be interfaces to external software
(both open source and otherwise). Currently, the targets are (roughly
in this order):

1) optimization (convex)
2) optimization (globa/nonlinear)
3) optimization (other)
4) machine learning (general)
5) development of optimization algorithms in ATS.
6) development of machine learning algorithms in ATS.
