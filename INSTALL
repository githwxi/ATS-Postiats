Step 1: Get the package

Step 4: Install the built package (optional)

######

Step 1: Get the package

The current release of ATS2 can be cloned by executing
the following command:

git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/ats2-lang/code ATS-Postiats

It can also be downloaded by following the link:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/ats2-lang/download

Say the tarball you download is named

ats2-lang-postiats-x.x.x.tgz

where x.x.x is the version of the package. You can untar it by
issuing the following command-line:

tar vxfz ats2-lang-postiats-x.x.x.tgz

which creates a directory named ATS-Postiats

######

Step 2: Get pre-requisites

libgmp is required for successful building of ATS2.

On e.g. Ubuntu Linus: sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev

######

Step 3: Build the package

First enter the directory containing the package:

cd ATS-Postiats

Then issue the next command-line:

./configure

When that completes, please issue the next command-line:

make all

After 'make' is finsihed, the two commands 'patscc' and 'patsopt' for
compiling ATS source code can be found in ATS-Postiats/bin. In order to
use this build, please set the environment variable PATSHOME as follows
(assuming the current directory is still ATS-Postiats):

export PATSHOME=`pwd`

######

Step 4. Install the built package (optional)

Assume that you want to install the package in a directory
named /path/to/MYATS/.

First please configure:

./configure --prefix==/path/to/MYATS

After configuration is done, please execute

make install

Please set PATSHOME as follows:

export PATSHOME=/path/to/MYATS/lib/ats2-postiats-x.x.x

###### end of [INSTALL] ######
