# Atspkgreloc

A utility for relocating files referenced in ATS source code

## Motivation for Atspkgreloc

When programming in ATS, a programmer can often find it very convenient to
directly refer to packages that are located removely.  When ATS source code
involving use of such packages needs to be compiled, atspkgreloc can be
called upon to copy these packages to a local directory so as to make them
directly accessible to the ATS compiler (ATS/Postiats).
