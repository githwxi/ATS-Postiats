This is mostly a utility for myself, but ...

Given a list of files (denoted by their paths), packing turns
them into a single file, which can be modified, and unpacking
turns this (possibly modified) single file into a list files
(which are usually supposed to replace the original list of files).

The utility is largely implemented. Now we need a convenience wrapper
to make [packedit] easier to user.
