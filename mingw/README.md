This directory contains some Windows-specific third-party source code
that is intended to provide solutions to some, but not all,
portability woes.

Please run `make` in an MSYS2 shell to fetch all third-party
dependencies from their respective authors. We strongly insist that
you have a working `wget` utility on your system (comes with MSYS2).
